## Hi there 👋

I’m [**Kirti**](https://www.figma.com/proto/LrsCyB9e2tim831uDKhzNA/Portfolio_June2025?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1-419&viewport=-1269%2C75%2C0.05&t=LzcbP95sv4KqFpg6-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=1%3A881), a designer based in Germany.

I love turning ideas into interfaces and experiences that are easy to understand, fun to use, and meaningful. 
Right now, I’m paddling my motivation boat toward a destination that’s not just about being a UX designer, but also a VR designer & developer who enjoys working with C++.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me painting, reading novels, or diving into anime & K-dramas.

**Fun Facts:**

- I prefer coffee over tea ☕
- Naruto is my all-time favorite anime 🍥
